Flask based web application [http://iceinsights.ca/] connected to a postgres database for accessing relevant advanced nhl stats on players and teams. The website currently allows you to look at every game event for any player, such as every shot, hit, penalty, etc. that the player took. Future features will include using the data and a sportsbook api to find lucrative bets, and an LLM powered chat interface to query any piece of data or specific nhl stat using plain language.
